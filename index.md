        <img src="/assets/img/coverflier-290x375.jpg" class="panel__image" />
        <p style="text-align: left;">This book looks at the 1841 census in Westmorland. I have covered the
            parishes of Grasmere and Windermere totalling 4,200 people with 203 pages including 26 maps, 46
            photographs and numerous census entries. I have described topics like bobbin manufacture , the
            yeoman farmer, the slate industry and early tourism.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Each chapter has an occupational directory for each chapelry or township
            along with place name and surname lists. It is fully indexed with a bibliography.Grasmere parish is
            divided into Grasmere township, Langdales and Rydal and Loughrigg. Ambleside has a chapter to
            itself although it sits in both Grasmere and Windermere parishes. Windermere parish is split into
            Applethwaite, Undermillbeck (north and south of Ferry Nab) and Troutbeck.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The photographs show some of the homes and workplaces that still exist
            today. The front cover photograph is of the Rattle Gill area of Ambleside.</p>

                    In all it provides an easily accessible overview of the two parishes and should be of

        <img src="/assets/img/julieperry.jpg" class="panel__image" />
        <p style="text-align: left;">I am a keen family and local historian and over the last 30 years have
            accrued a lot of information.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I worked in public libraries for nearly 20 years and my time in Blackpool
            local studies department started me on my family history trail.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">My mothers roots are in Westmorland around Shap, Windermere, Troutbeck and
            Kendal. I particularly enjoyed delving into the census as it showed everyday life in an area where
            my ancestors lived and worked. This is how I came to put this e-book together with help from my
            partner Roger who showed me patiently how to master microsoft word.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Special thanks to Rog and also to my son Tim who made this website for me.</p>
